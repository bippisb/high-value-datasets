The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) dataset provides detailed information on the implementation of the MGNREGA program in India. The MGNREGA program is a flagship social welfare program of the Indian government that guarantees 100 days of employment to every rural household in the country, with a special focus on the poorest and most marginalized communities. The dataset includes information on the number of households and individuals who have benefited from the program, the amount of funds disbursed, and the types of work undertaken by program beneficiaries. The dataset is organized according to various dimensions, such as state, district, and financial year, making it easy for users to filter and analyze the data according to their specific needs. The dataset is relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, including government officials, social scientists, policy think tanks, media houses, and newsrooms. The data is collected and maintained by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, and is available for download on the MGNREGA website. The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and journalists interested in issues related to rural employment, poverty reduction, social inclusion, and sustainable development in India.

### SHG Financial and Member Profile Details

Granularity: SHG

Frequency: Other

This dataset provides an extensive and nuanced profile of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) across diverse geographic and socio-economic contexts. It includes detailed information on the SHG's location, specifying the state, district, block, Gram Panchayat, and village, alongside a unique SHG identifier and its name. Key administrative details such as the date of formation, type of SHG, promoting entity, and banking informationâ€”including the bank name, branch, and account opening dateâ€”are also recorded. The dataset meticulously documents membership demographics, including total membership counts, gender distribution, and classifications by social categories such as Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Other Backward Classes, and Other Social Categories. Additionally, it captures data on members with disabilities, both self-disabled and those with disabled family members, and provides insights into religious affiliations (Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi) and economic status, distinguishing between Above Poverty Line (APL), Below Poverty Line (BPL), and Poorest of the Poor under the PIP category.

### CGWB - Changes in Depth to Water Level

Granularity: Station

Frequency: 

Central Ground Water Board monitors groundwater levels throughout the country on a regional scale, four times in a year during the months of March/April/May, August, November and January.This data is collected under the mode of acquisition “Manual”.  For monitoring of ground water level, CGWB has a dedicated network of about 25000 monitoring stations called “National Hydrograph Network Stations (NHNS)”, which comprises open dug wells and purpose-built bore/tube wells for water level monitoring called piezometers.  Similarly, CGWB has initiated automatic high frequency monitoring by installing Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLR) with telemetry systems under the National Hydrology Project (NHP).   This data is collected under the mode of acquisition “Telemetry”.
